# Number_Guessing_Game

You are going to create a game in which you will have to guess a number. This game will have to offer different options and guide the player throughout the game.
When launching the algorithm, you must first greet the user and ask them to choose a level of difficulty. This choice will influence the number of trials as well as the range of possible numbers. Here are the details for the different levels:
Very easy: Unlimited trials, 1 to 10
Easy: 5 tries, 1 to 10
Medium, 5 tries, 1 to 100
Difficult, 8 tries, 1 to 500
Very difficult, 9 tries, 1 to 1000
Once the difficulty is chosen, the algorithm selects a number at random and asks the user to start guessing. For each incorrect attempt, it will be necessary to indicate whether the number sought is smaller or larger.
If the player manages to find the correct answer, the game is over and the player is congratulated. If he cannot find the solution within the allotted number of tries, he gets a game over and the number sought is displayed. The user then has the option to end the program or start a new game.

This game can be coded in the language of your choice. While we are not asking for a pseudocode version, we want to document your thought process with comments in your code.
